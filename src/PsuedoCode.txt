-	This program creates a fictional person class with methods to get color, make and model

        create a FictionalPerson.h Class declaration header file.

        declare a constant class private member "firstName" variable to store the firstName of the person.
        declare a constant class private member "lastName" variable to store the lastName of the person.
        declare a constant class private member "streetAddress" variable to store the street address of the person.
        declare a constant class private member "city" variable to store the city of the person.
        declare a constant class private member "zipCode" variable to store the zip code of the person.

        declare a class private method "setFirstName" which takes a validly named constant string parameter as an argument and returns void to set the firstname of the person.
        declare a class private method "setLastName" which takes a validly named constant string parameter as an argument and returns void to set the lastname of the person.
        declare a class private method "setStreetAddress" which takes a validly named constant string parameter as an argument and returns void to set the street address of the person.
        declare a class private method "setCity" which takes a validly named constant string parameter as an argument and returns void to set the city of the person.
        declare a class private method "setZipCode" which takes a validly named constant string parameter as an argument and returns void to set the zip code of the person.

        declare a class public method "getFirstName" which returns a constant - the firstname of the person.
        declare a class public method "getLastName" which returns a constant - the lastname of the person.
        declare a class public method "getStreetAddress" which returns a constant - the street address of the person.
        declare a class public method "getCity" which returns a constant - the city of the person.
        declare a class public method "getZipCode" which returns a constant - the zip code of the person.
        declare a class public method "toString" which returns a constant - a string concatenation of the firstname, lastname, street address, city and zip code of the person.

        declare a class constructor that accepts the firstName, lastName, streetAddress, city, zipCode as parameters.
        The body of the constructor should set the corresponding class member variables to the parameter values using the corresponding setter methods.

        create the FictionalPerson.cpp Class definition implementation cpp file.

        define a class private method "setFirstName" which takes a validly named string parameter as an argument and returns void, setting the firstName member variable of the class to this parameter.
        define a class private method "setLastName" which takes a validly named string parameter as an argument and returns void, setting the lastName member variable of the class to this parameter.
        define a class private method "setStreetAddress" which takes a validly named string parameter as an argument and returns void, setting the streetAddress member variable of the class to this parameter.
        define a class private method "setCity" which takes a validly named string parameter as an argument and returns void, setting the city member variable of the class to this parameter.
        define a class private method "setZipCode" which takes a validly named string parameter as an argument and returns void, setting the zipCode member variable of the class to this parameter.

        define a class public method "getFirstName" which returns the firstName parameter of the class.
        define a class public method "getLastName" which returns the lastName parameter of the class.
        define a class public method "getStreetAddress" which returns the streetAddress parameter of the class.
        define a class public method "getCity" which returns the city parameter of the class.
        define a class public method "getZipCode" which returns the zipCode parameter of the class.
        define a class public method "toString" which returns a string concatenation of the firstName, lastName, streetAddress, City and zipCode parameters of the class.

        define a class constructor that accepts the firstName, lastName, streetAddress, city, zipCode as parameters.
        The body of the constructor should set the corresponding class member variables to the parameter values using the corresponding class setter methods.

    declare a main function to run the program.
    create a new fictional person instance and store it in a variable.
